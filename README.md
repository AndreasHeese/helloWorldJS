# Hello World in Saxon JS 2

This is a fork of helloWorldJS by ndw. In his readme file, ndw writes:

I'm just starting to discover Saxon JS and stumbled upon this project when searching for a "hello world" example. To grasp the basics, I chopped off everything dispensable, especially concerning the mentioned test case. So yes, I do want this code and it shouldn't be deleted.

The docs folder contains the example including the compiled XSLT file and the SaxonJS2 file to experience the [index.html](https://andreasheese.github.io/helloWorldJS/) working.
